# Building a Berkik 3

## Additional Materials Needed:
- **Depron Foam**: For the wing structure.
- **Carbon Fiber Rods**: For linkages between servos and control horns.
- **Adhesive**: For assembly.
- **Cutting Tools**: X-Acto knife, hobby knife, or hot wire cutter.
- **Ruler and Pen**: For measurements and markings.

- **Tape and Velcro**: For securing components and reinforcing edges.
- **Covering Material**: Optional for aesthetics and protection (e.g., colored tape or heat shrink film).

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Design or Select a Plan:
- Sketch your own design, including dimensions for wingspan, chord length, and control surfaces (elevons). Alternatively, download the berkik plan from the plans folder of this repository.

### 2. Cutting:
- **Mark the depron sheet**: Use the plan to mark the outlines on the sheet.
- **Cut the Shape**: Carefully cut the shapes using a sharp knife or hot wire cutter.

### 3. Reinforcing the Wing:
- **Taping**: Attach the cutouts using tape.
- **Usw adhesive**: Secure the cutouts with glue to add strength to the wing.

### 4. Assembling the model:

- **Add Elevons**: Cut out elevons and attach them to the trailing edge of the wing using tape hinges or glue hinges.

### 5. Mounting Electronics:
- **Cut Slots for Servos**: Cut slots for servos near the elevons and secure them with glue.
- **Install Control Horns**: Attach control horns to the elevons.
- **Connect Linkages**: Connect the servos to the control horns using linkage rods.
- **Mount the Motor**: Attach the motor mount to the rear of the wing, and secure the motor.
- **Install the ESC**: Secure the ESC close to the motor, ensuring it’s connected properly to the motor wires.
- **Receiver Placement**: Place the receiver in a secure spot and connect the servos and ESC to the appropriate channels.

### 6. Final Assembly:
- **Battery Compartment**: Create a compartment or secure area for the battery with Velcro.
- **Propeller Installation**: Attach the propeller to the motor.
- **Covering**: Optionally, cover the wing with tape or heat shrink film for durability and aesthetics.

### 7. Balancing the Wing:
- **Center of Gravity (CG)**: Determine the recommended CG location from the plan.
- **Balance Check**: Adjust the position of the battery and electronics to balance the wing correctly at the CG point.

### 8. Configuring the Transmitter:
 - **Elevon Mixing**: Most modern transmitters have a mixing function for elevons. This will combine the aileron and elevator channels to control both servos for pitch and roll.
- **Servo Centering**: Ensure the servos are centered, and the elevons are neutral.
- **Range Test**: Perform a range test to ensure reliable communication between the transmitter and receiver.


### 9. Maiden Flight:
- **Launch**: Hand launch or use a bungee launch system.
- **Trim Adjustments**: Make trim adjustments during the initial flights to ensure stable flight.

## Tips:
- **Practice**: If you’re new to flying wings, practice flying with a simulator or a trainer plane first.
- **Safety**: Always perform a pre-flight safety check and fly in an open area away from people and obstacles.


By following these steps, you can build and fly your own RC plane: Berkik. Enjoy the process and happy flying!
